# **So, you think you know?**
## **Site Overview**
The 'So, You Think You Know?' website was created to provide a fun entertaiment for whoever would like to test if they have the knowledge on the questions being put on the website. The objective is to offer four differents options of answers so that the user can choose the correct one. By the end, they can upload their score to the Top Scores table. If they are one of the top five, their score will be shown.

## **Planning stage**
### **Target Audiences:**
* Users interested in quiz games.
* Users interested in general knowledge.
* Users interested in trying to score higher than their friends.
‚Äã
### **User Stories:**
* As a user, I want to have fun.
* As a user, I want the website to be fast and provide me with questions quickly.
* As a user, I want to know if my answer was the correct one or not.
* As a user, I want to know how good I am in comparison to other players.
‚Äã
### **Site Aims:**
* To provide a fun interactive game.
* To create a challenge for the user and the players.
* Light and easily accessed by anyone anywhere.
‚Äã
### **Color Scheme:**
‚Äã
The colors chosen were white(#fff), black(#000) and variations of grey(#7E8287). It gives the website a sobriety and style and also do not distract the user from the questions and the available. The only two other colors that vary from that are the colors green (#4F9D69) and red (#ff5400), to show to the user if they have chosen the correct or wrong answers, respectively.
‚Äã
## **Typography**
‚Äã
* Throughout the page, there are two fonts used:
  * Mukta - For the logo. It gives a slim image without distancing the website from the user.
  * Josefin Sans - For all the other text in the website.
‚Äã
* Both fonts were used to complement eachother. They provide clean visuals regardless of the screensize.
* All fonts were sourced from Google fonts, as stated in the credits.
‚Äã
## **Current Features**
‚Äã
#### *Entrance:*

* This part of the page is divided in two parts: the name/logo of the page and the buttons, to access either the game itself or the topscores table.
* There is only one change when accessed on bigsreens, where the buttons change the column direction to a row one.

#### *Game:*

* The game is divided in three different parts: the hud, where it shows how many questions have been answered until that point and the amount of points; the question; and the four different available answers.
* When a user chooses one of the answers, the background changes to inform the user if they got it right or wrong, with a green or red color, respectively.

#### *Congratulations and Topscores:*

* This page can be accessed on the entrance of the game or after the user answers ten questions. If it is accessed without playing the game, the page only shows to the user the topscores and the "Play Game" button. If they finish the game, they are greeted with a congratulations message, their score and the possibility of registering the score.
* The registration requires a name and email. The same user is allowed to play more than once and register their score.

‚Äã
## **Future-Enhancements**
‚Äã
* The website uses a small base of questions to randomly present to the user. After futher study of Javascript, the funcionality of fetch can be added to the code to collect from a source a bigger availability of questions.
‚Äã
## **Testing Phase**
‚Äã
* Responsiveness - To ensure that the responsiveness of the website was the best possible, to project was built having the mobile access as the base of the design. The initial tests were made on the mobile, extensively and in different models, to confirm that the website was delivering what it was proposed.

    On mobile, the website was tested on the following devices:
    * Samsung 20FE
    * Iphone 13 Pro Max

    No issues were noted upon project completion.

    On tablets, the website was tested on the following device:
    * Ipad Air 4

    No issues were noted upon project completion.

    On notebooks, the website was tested on the following devices:
    * Dell Latitute 15
    * Macbook Air

    No issues were noted upon project completion.

    For the desktop tests, an Asus VX228 monitor was also used.
    No issues were noted upon project completion.
‚Äã
* Functionality - 
    * On entrance of the game, both buttons, when clicked bring the user to the relevant section. Topscores buttons does not shows the congratulations message or the option to add the score.
    * While on game, the user can choose one of the options, the click provides the user with the information if they were correct on their choice (the background color of the option changes to red or green, if wrong or correct, respectively) and also calls the function for another question to be presented.
    * When user answers 10 questions, the final section is presented, with the user score and with the possibility for them to add to the top 5 scores.
    * The user is requested to add their name and email to be able to add the score. The top scores are them updated with the new information, if the score is within the top five.
    * On the last section, a play game is also displayed, if the user desires to play the game again.
